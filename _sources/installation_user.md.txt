##  Known Issues

### undefined symbol: H5Pset_*
Sometimes, the package causes an error similar to `undefined symbol: H5Pset_fapl_ros3`. 

Downgrading `h5py` to 3.1 with the following command fixes it:

```shell
pip install h5py==3.1
```

### UnsatisfiableError: The following specifications were *

```python
UnsatisfiableError: The following specifications were found to be incompatible with each other:

This is usually fixable when fixing the python version to 3.9.13 when creating the enviorment.
